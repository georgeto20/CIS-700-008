My game is based on the famous Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. I picked this topic because it is one of my favorite book series, especially within the genre of science fiction. The story of the game is similar to the very beginning of the series: the player wakes up and discovers that the Earth will soon be destroyed by the Vogons. Among the possible locations in the game are Home, Pub, Bank, Bookstore, Pet Store, Ship Bridge, and Ship. The goal of the game is to get from Home to Ship without getting killed; to be admitted on the ship, the player must have bought a Babel fish at the Pet Store and a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide at the Bookstore. Furthermore, there is a block on the Ship Bridge in the form of a Vogon, who demands that the player bring him a poetry book, which can also be bought at the Bookstore. The Pub is more of a fun location in the game; it serves no real purpose other than to make light of the player's dire situation, and to give the player a chance to buy one last drink before the Earth's inevitable demise. However, the player will be killed if he lingers for too long (3 moves) at the Pub.
